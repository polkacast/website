# **Polkacast Dao**

DAO is composed of: DAU + DAC.

The acronym DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. DAO in the Polkacast protocol is made up of both DAC and DAU.
Every new podcast creator is a member of the DAO, which is known here as a Decentralized Autonomous Creator (DAC).

The DAC is determined by Decentralized Autonomous Creator (DAC), which is the number of active users who have entered this DAC.
If the current DAC adheres to the smart contract model, it is designated as one of the nominee DACs. At this time, the DAC will apply to become one of the nodes and stake a certain amount of CAST.
