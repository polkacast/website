# Frequently Asked Questions

### What’s a podcasts

Podcasting is a form of digital media in which a list of audio, video, electronic radio stations, or text files is released on the Internet, and listeners subscribe to the list using electronic devices to download or stream the electronic files in it, thereby receiving the content.The term "podcast" is a combination of the words "iPod" and "Broadcast".

### What’s the future of podcasts

According to Edison and Triton Digital's new study , the proportion of Americans over the age of 12 who have listened to podcasts will continue to grow in 2021, rising from 55 percent last year to 57 percent this year, or around 162 million people. The number of people who are aware of podcasts and who listen to them is growing in the United States. After smashing through the 100 million mark for the first time in history last year (accounting for 37 percent), monthly podcast listeners surpassed 40 percent this year, hitting 116 million and setting a new record.

### What is the  polkacast protocol

Polkacast is a protocol network that was built and developed using Substrate, IPFS, smart contracts, and Wasm technologies. Polkacast offers a high degree of community autonomy, unified network and other features.In addition to its own protocol for access, the Polkacast protocol also provides basic podcast hosting BaaS platform, Web dApp, Polkacast podcatcher etc.

In addition to using the platform's own services, any user or developer may build their own independent dApp by connecting directly to the Polkacast protocol's SDK or NPM.The Polkacast protocol aims to provide podcast creators with an easy, fast, simple, and profitable podcast ecosystem by enabling community autonomy, token economy, EP NFT, privacy security, and other features.

### What is Cast

Polkacast issued Polkacast (Cast) based on Ethereum to enable developers, creators, early users, and investors to be involved in the Polkacast ecosystem and to continue network maintenance, governance, and other models. In the future, Cast can be applied to both Ethereum 2.0 and the Polkadot network.

In the early development stage of the Polkacast Protocol, the ERC20 Cast is issued on the Ethereum network.The total amount is 930 million and will be fixed perpetually.When the Polkacast mainnet is launched, ERC20 Cast will be exchanged to native Cast on its own blockchain network in a 1:1 ratio.

### How Cast Token Distribution

Total supply: 930 million

PoC staking: 40%

`10%: Unlocked and returned to Dao within 1 years, following the release of the mainnet, the community and developers will set up PoS nodes. With the rewards earned during that time span will be used to repurchase Ctape.`

`30%: After the mainnet goes online, Staking nodes will receive an annual boost of 4% to 6% in inflation rewards.`

Investor: 20%

Team: 25%

DAC IP Plan: 10%

Early Sales: 5%

### What is Ctape

Ctape is the gas of the polkacast network, which is mainly used for interaction between users, stacking, smart gas fee, etc.

Total supply: 4.65 billion.

There is no circulation for the Ctape token until Polkacast mainnet releases. When the Polkacast Protocol mainnet goes live, Ctape will be distributed at a 1:5 ratio based on the users who already hold Cast. Since 40% of the Cast will be locked initially, the initial circulation of Ctape will be 60% of the total, resulting in up to 2.79 billion Ctape in circulation. Following the launch of the mainnet, the remaining 40% of Ctape will be distributed to podcast creators and ecosystem users with an annual inflation rate of 5% to 10% based on Dac and Dau through the PoC and PoS dual consensus.

### What is dual dao governance

Polkacast governance is divided into four parts:  dac node, technical committee, supervisory committee, and freelancer.
Polkacast employs a "fluid democracy" system that allows free dau users to enter the dac. Dac is an organization made up of individuals or groups that have common beliefs and are reliable.The primary rights and responsibilities are to propose and control the implementation and governance of the Polkacast protocol, as well as other proposals.

For example, dac may initiate a proposal for equal token distribution. The technical committee creates a smart contract and submits it to the proposal management center for approval.Other dacs and daus will vote as well. It succeeds if more than half of the votes are cast in favor of it; otherwise, it fails.

The technical committee is similar to the government and is solely responsible for bringing the voting results into effect.The technical committee is limited by the Supervision Committee and is made up of the official technical team of Cast and freelance developers.The technical committee is the last technical committee to deploy the code and the last line of protection to avoid errors in the polkacast protocol.The technical committee cannot initiate a proposal, but it does have the power to expedite implementation following the referendum results. Once the technical committee's recommendations are approved and enforced, all nodes will be upgraded.

The supervision committee nodes will be elected based on all dac nodes; the initial number of supervision committee nodes will be 5-10,and it will increase in accordance with the creation of the Polkacast protocol, the size of the community, and the developed dac,and it will decrease in accordance with the growth of users entering the dac nodes; the number will not be more than 30, and it will not be less than 5.

The supervision committee's key privileges and responsibilities are as follows: "The supervisory committee acts like the US House of representatives,responsible for drafting and formulating legislation, as well as vetoing any harmful or pointless proposals." The supervision committee is not the only organization that initiates proposals.proposals may also be submitted by Cast holders.After reviewing them, the supervision committee may either expedite the proposal's entry into the referendum stage or screen out risky proposals.

Freelancer are users or third-party developers who own a certain amount of Cast tokens but have not entered the dac.In its early stages, it is made up of three groups. According to the development of the community, there are no more than 8 Freelancer.The primary role is to prevent the other three parties from entering into illicit transactions under the control of interests,thus undermining the free creation of the polkacast protocol.

### What is the vision of the polkacast protocol
 
The goal of the polkacast protocol is to become a parachain of the polkadot network, and benefit from the thriving cross-chain ecosystem and shared security, and to provide podcast creators and users with a better and safer non-fork network, and Community autonomous services.

The definition of podcasting is that everyone can openly share their thoughts, feelings, and identities.Podcasting's most compelling attribute is its freedom. Personal podcasters share their views, while corporate podcasts broadcast corporate values.We believe that anyone or any organization should build their own independent podcast and brand with their own distinct personality and style.The group members decide whether the project succeeds or fails. The polkacast protocal’s aim is to genuinely delegate control to each and every user.

### What is a podcatcher

A podcatcher is a piece of software designed to "catch" podcasts.Podcasts are an episodic form of digital media similar to episodic radio shows.The difference is that podcasts are distributed digitally through the internet, and must be downloaded to a device to be listened to,where a radio just picks up radio waves and if you listen at the right time you hear the show you want to hear.

Podcatchers allow you to collate and catalog podcasts to be collected as new episodes are released, rather than individually seeking out podcasts to download and listen to.

Podcatchers allow you to "catch" all new episodes of a podcast immediately, rather than finding them as they come out and manually downloading them to listen to.

### Why Dual Token

From a security perspective, the goal of the Polkacast protocol is to become a parachain of the Polkadot ecosystem. When too many chains are interoperable, linked, and transacted, unexpected things can happen. As a result, the Polkacast protocol employs a dual token model to avoid unnecessary risks.

From a transaction standpoint, the dual token model can be used to optimize utility more effectively in order to increase TPS. Cast serves as the cornerstone, while Ctape serves as network gas consumption, such as user contact, transactions, incentives, and payment orders.
